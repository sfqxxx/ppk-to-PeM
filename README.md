# Converting PPK to PEM Format Using PuTTYgen

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to convert a **PPK (PuTTY Private Key)** file to **PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail)** format using PuTTYgen. This conversion is essential when you need to use your AWS key pair with different SSH clients or tools that require PEM format.

## When You Need This Conversion

You'll need to convert PPK to PEM format when:

- ✅ **Using OpenSSH clients** on Linux/Mac systems
- ✅ **Working with AWS CLI** commands that require PEM keys
- ✅ **Using third-party SSH tools** that don't support PPK format
- ✅ **Automating deployments** with scripts that expect PEM keys
- ✅ **Working with Docker containers** or CI/CD pipelines

---

## Prerequisites

- **PuTTYgen** installed on your Windows machine
  - Download from: [Official PuTTY Download Page](https://www.putty.org/)
- An existing **PPK file** (generated from AWS Console or created previously)
- Basic understanding of SSH key pairs

### 1. Launch PuTTYgen

- Open **PuTTYgen** application on your Windows machine
- You should see the PuTTY Key Generator window

### 2. Load Your Existing PPK File

1. Click the **Load** button in the PuTTYgen interface
2. **Navigate** to the directory where your `.ppk` file is stored
3. **Select** your PPK file and click **Open**
4. The key will be loaded and you'll see key information displayed

### 3. Export to PEM Format

1. From the **top menu bar**, click **Conversions**
2. Select **Export OpenSSH key** from the dropdown menu
   - This exports in PEM format compatible with OpenSSH
3. **Alternative**: You can also use **Export OpenSSH key (force new file format)** for newer OpenSSH versions

### 4. Handle the Security Warning

- A popup dialog will appear asking about saving without a passphrase
- Click **Yes** to proceed (or **No** if you want to add a passphrase for extra security)

### 5. Save Your PEM File

1. Choose the **destination folder** where you want to save the PEM file
2. **Enter a filename** with `.pem` extension (e.g., `my-key.pem`)
3. Click **Save**

### 6. Verify the Conversion

Your PPK file has now been successfully converted to PEM format! The new PEM file can be used with various SSH clients and tools.

---

## Verification

### Test Your PEM File

**On Windows (using Command Prompt):**
```bash
ssh -i "path/to/your-key.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-ip-address
```

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod 400 your-key.pem
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip-address
```

### Check File Format

**View the PEM file content:**
```bash
cat your-key.pem
```

You should see content starting with:
```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **"Unable to load key file"** | Ensure the PPK file isn't corrupted and is accessible |
| **PEM file doesn't work with SSH** | Check file permissions (should be 400 or 600) |
| **"Permission denied (publickey)"** | Verify you're using the correct username for your EC2 instance |
| **Conversion menu not visible** | Update to the latest version of PuTTYgen |

### File Permission Issues

**On Linux/Mac systems, set correct permissions:**
```bash
chmod 400 your-key.pem
```

**On Windows, ensure only you have access to the file:**
- Right-click the PEM file → Properties → Security → Advanced
- Remove all users except yourself and SYSTEM

---

## Security Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- **Store keys securely** - Keep both PPK and PEM files in a secure location
- **Set restrictive permissions** - Use `chmod 400` on Linux/Mac
- **Use descriptive names** - Name files clearly (e.g., `aws-prod-key.pem`)
- **Backup your keys** - Keep secure backups of both formats
- **Use passphrases** - Consider adding passphrases for extra security

### ❌ Avoid This

- **Don't share private keys** - Never share or commit keys to version control
- **Don't use overly permissive permissions** - Avoid `777` or `666` permissions
- **Don't store in public locations** - Keep away from public folders or cloud drives
- **Don't reuse keys across environments** - Use separate keys for dev/staging/prod

## File Format Comparison

| Format | Extension | Used By | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **PPK** | `.ppk` | PuTTY, WinSCP | Windows-specific, binary format |
| **PEM** | `.pem` | OpenSSH, AWS CLI | Cross-platform, text-based |

---

## Alternative Methods

### Using AWS CLI (if you have the original key pair)

```bash
# If you have the original key pair, you can generate PEM directly
aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --key-names your-key-name
```

### Using OpenSSL (for advanced users)

```bash
# Convert PEM to different formats if needed
openssl rsa -in your-key.pem -outform PEM -out converted-key.pem
```

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Set proper permissions (Linux/Mac)
chmod 400 your-key.pem

# Test SSH connection
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-server-ip

# View key fingerprint
ssh-keygen -lf your-key.pem

# Test key without connecting
ssh -i your-key.pem -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5 ec2-user@your-server-ip echo "Connection successful"
```

---

**Success!** Your PPK file has been converted to PEM format and is ready to use with OpenSSH clients, AWS CLI, and other tools that require PEM format keys.

> **Remember:** Always keep your private keys secure and use appropriate file permissions to protect them from unauthorized access.
